## Data Structure & Algorithms üìà

### What is Data Structure?

A data structure is a way to store and organize data in memory in order to facilitate access and modifications. In Algopedia, we cover a range of data structures, including:
- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue

For each data structure, we provide a brief overview of what it is and how it works, as well as code examples to help you get started.

### What is Algorithms?

An algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. In Algopedia, we cover a range of algorithms, including:
- Searching Algorithms (e.g. Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Sorting Algorithms (e.g. Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Shell Sort)

For each algorithm, we provide a brief overview of what it is and how it works, as well as code examples to help you get started.

### **Characteristics of a Data Structure**

When evaluating a data structure, there are a few key characteristics to consider:

- **Correctness** ‚àí Data structure implementation should implement its interface correctly.

- **Time Complexity** ‚àí Running time or the execution time of operations of data structure must be as small as possible

- **Space Complexity** ‚àí Memory usage of a data structure operation should be as little as possible.
